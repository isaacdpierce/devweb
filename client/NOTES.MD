# Functional components

- Do not have any state
- Do not have any life-cycle components

## render()

- a life-cycle method on class components which will render to the UI whatever is after the return statement

## React router

- Allows us to connect and link to other components via custom url

## Browser Router

- allows browser back and forward navigation
- import { BrowserRouter as Router} -> allows me to use Router in code instead of having to write BrowserRouter every time
- Specify 'exact' in a Route to make sure it shows only the specified route
